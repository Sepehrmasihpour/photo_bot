"""
Take a hard coded file id in the data file that is meant for testing and give it to this endpoint here and than assert the response. test the method using postman to see 
what are it's limits in whitch condition it can perform and in witch it cannot and than. write tests wtihout mocking that will reflect those condotions. 
so for now the agenda is to write a single test using a real file_id that will be hard_coded in the data module. the next thing in the agenda is to just play wiht the changeGroupPhoto
on the postman to see what further tests it requires.
