# This is what I want the end result of the seshat in the telegram group side to end up, atleast for now.

## 1.seperation of content:

I wnat it to be able to seperate content into different based on their catogories to different topics.
there will be default catogories like the photo catogorie or the music catogorie in which the bot will automaticly detect the updates that fall into this catogireis and
moves then checks their location in the group if they are in the righ place(like if someone posted a photo in the photo topic section) than the bot will do nothing, but if it is not in the right catogorie it will repost it in the right topic locatin without altering the original post.

## 2. Democracy:

I want the bot to be the only one beside the owner to be able to do things that will effect the group as a whole like changing the name,
removing/adding user, changing the the group details, and etc. I want all of this to be decided by placing a command to the bot like remove user
and than an annonomys vote will be set that will be only open for a predetermined amount of time. and than by the decide of that annonymous poll the bot will decide to weather do that thing or not, this is only conjucture but there should be an option to allow the user to decide weather they want there name to be anonymous or not as the starter of the proposal

# Data base:

I have realized that I need a database to implent the futures I want into the applicatin so I will look into it for now and create a new branch for it alone.
